## How It Works

Movie Match operates through several interconnected components that work together to provide accurate and personalized movie recommendations. Here's a breakdown of its core functionalities:

### 1. **User Preferences Input**

- **Watched List**: Users input movies they've watched along with their reviews.
- **Preference Extraction**: The system analyzes these inputs to determine the user's preferred genres, emotional tones, and preferred release year categories.

### 2. **Emotion and Sentiment Analysis**

- **Emotion Analysis**: Utilizes the `nateraw/bert-base-uncased-emotion` model from HuggingFace's Transformers library to identify emotions present in user reviews.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Employs TextBlob to classify user reviews as positive (`like`) or negative (`dislike`) based on the polarity of the text.

### 3. **Recommendation Generation**

- **Filtering Criteria**:
  - **Genres Matching**: Recommends movies that match a specified number of preferred genres (dynamic based on user input).
  - **Emotions Matching**: Ensures that the emotional tone of movie reviews aligns with user preferences.
  - **Rating and Popularity**: Considers only movies with an average rating above 6.5 and more than 50,000 votes to ensure quality recommendations.
- **Handling Duplicate Titles**: When users input movie titles that have multiple entries with different release years, the system prompts users to select the correct one, ensuring accurate data processing.

### 4. **Watch Lists Management**

- **Watched List**: Logs movies the user has watched, along with their reviews and sentiment classifications.
- **Watch Later List**: Stores recommended movies for future viewing, allowing users to manage their viewing queue effectively.

### 5. **Web Scraping for Reviews**

- **IMDb Integration**: Fetches the most supported reviews for movies directly from IMDb to analyze the emotional content.
- **Polite Scraping**: Incorporates delays between requests to avoid overwhelming IMDb's servers and to adhere to ethical scraping practices.

## Troubleshooting

### **1. Module Not Found Errors**

**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'`

**Solution**:

- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Activate your virtual environment if you're using one.
- Re-run the installation command:

  ```bash
  pip install transformers torch textblob requests beautifulsoup4 nltk
  ```

### **2. NLTK Data Not Downloaded**

**Issue**: Errors related to missing NLTK data when running TextBlob.

**Solution**:

- Ensure you've downloaded the `punkt` tokenizer.

  ```python
  import nltk
  nltk.download('punkt')
  ```

### **3. IMDb Scraping Issues**

**Issue**: Reviews not being found or errors during scraping.

**Solution**:

- **Check IMDb's Page Structure**: IMDb may update its website, breaking the scraping logic.
  - Inspect the IMDb review page using browser developer tools.
  - Update the BeautifulSoup selectors in the `scrape_most_supported_review` function accordingly.
- **JavaScript-Rendered Content**: If reviews are loaded dynamically, consider using Selenium to render JavaScript.
  - **Note**: This adds complexity and requires additional setup.

### **4. Network Issues**

**Issue**: Unable to fetch reviews due to network instability or IMDb blocking requests.

**Solution**:

- **Stable Internet Connection**: Ensure your device is connected to the internet.
- **Implement Rate Limiting**: Increase `time.sleep()` durations between requests to prevent overwhelming IMDb's servers.
- **Respect IMDb's Terms**: Avoid excessive scraping to prevent IP blocking.
